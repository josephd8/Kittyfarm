## Project Charter

### Vision

Cryptokitties is a blockchain-based game that allows players to purchase, collent, breed, and sell virtual cats.

Kittyfarm will live assist beginner CryptoKitties owners in building their kitty "farm". (https://www.cryptokitties.co/)

### Mission

Kitty owners have an opportunity to build the value of their litter through breeding, but what breeding decisions are most likely to introduce valuable mutatuions and gene sets, thus increasing the litter value?

Kittyfarm will give owners the ability to simulate the breeding of two cats and view the probabilities of given genes. Kitty farm will also take those gene probabilities to infer an "expected value" of the new baby kitten. These core functionalities of Kittyfarm will help kitty owners make the right tradeoffs between cost of breeding and potential value increases through breeding.

### Success criteria

**Machine Learning**: The supervised models will be tasked with taking a mother cat and a sire (father) and essentially predicting the genome of the baby kitten. Predicting kitten genomes will enable Kittyfarm to show the traits that a kitten is most likely to inherit. Utilitizing 400k+ breeding instances, Kittyfarm will test the accuracy of models based on % of correct Cattributes (as they are called.) A relative service, CryptoBreeder.net, claims to achieve 94% accuracy in this metric. Thus, Kittyfarm will seek to achieve a correct Cattribute prediction rate of 95%.

And Kittyfarm will not stop there! With the probabilities of genes from a simulated breed, Kitty farm will create every possibility of baby kitten that could be created with those possible genes. Then, Kittyfarm will cross-check those potential kittens against the data itself to derive expected values, which will be weighted by likelihood and then aggregated to provide an overall expected value of the new baby kitten.

**Business**: Kittyfarm aims to provide real value to owners by helping them turn their breeding decisions into Ether (the cryptocurrency that powers CryptoKitties). From a usage perspective, the target metrics are 100 new users per month, 50% of users make a re-visit, and 1000 simulations generated per month. From a monetary perspective, Kittyfarm can assess real value by how willing users are to donate Ether in the form of tips to my Ether wallet. The monetary target metric is .061 Ether/month (currently $10 USD).

This project structure was partially influenced by the [Cookiecutter Data Science project](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

## Running the application

### Set up environment

The `requirements.txt` file contains the packages required to run the model code. An environment can be set up in two ways. See bottom of README for exploratory data analysis environment setup. 

#### With `virtualenv`

```bash
pip install virtualenv

virtualenv kitty

source kitty/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

#### With `conda`

```bash
conda create -n kitty python=3.7
conda activate kitty
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### Fetching Kitty Data via API

#### Apply for Cryptokitty API credentials

Sign up for Cryptokitty API Access here: https://docs.api.cryptokitties.co/view/4668563/RWTrPGvN/?version=latest
After filling out the typeform, you will have to wait for them to email you your api token. They claim that this normally takes ~2-3 days.

#### Set API Token in Environmental Variables

Set your API Token as an environmental variable that the fetch_data.py script will use. Use the "Token" given to you by Cryptokitties, not the "Auth Token".
 
```bash
export KITTY_TOKEN=insert_api_token_here
```

#### Configure AWS command line tools

Create an access key: In the AWS console, go to "My Security Credentials" under your
username in the top right corner. Press `Create Access Key`. Save
your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key .

Configure aws command line tools in order to load files directly to S3 bucket.

```bash
pip install awscli --upgrade
aws configure
```

Follow the prompt to enter your aws key, aws secret, and aws region. This will allow automatic access to write and read from your S3 bucket.

Finally, set the S3 bucket name as an environmental variable:

```bash
export KITTY_BUCKET=insert_bucket_name_here
```

#### Run fetch_sample_data.py script

The Cryptokitties data is updated as kittie's attributes changed - so calling the API at any time will give you up-to-date kitty info. Thus, there are no time parameters to the API call. In fact, because we are calling the "getKitties" endpoint, the only parameters are `limit` and `offset`, which can be reset within the fetch_sample_data.py script if you would like to get a larger or different sample. 

```bash
python src/fetch_sample_data.py
```

You should see successful logging messages as the sample data is called and put into your S3 bucket. The sample is a json file with data for 1000 kitties. 

It should be noted that the fetch_data.py script will work though a series of calls, each grabbing 5000 kitties at a time, until it has landed each kitties data into the S3 bucket (~1.6 million kitties, ~200 .json files, ~6.5 gb).

### Configure Flask app

`config.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"
PORT = 3000
APP_NAME = "kittyfarm"
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
db_path = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "app/kittyDB.db")
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///{}'.format(db_path)
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True
HOST = "127.0.0.1"
```

### Initialize the database

To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` with one initial kitty, run:

`python run.py create`

To add additional kitties:

`python run.py ingest --name="KitKittyKitten`

There are many more optional arguments available to use when ingesting a new kitty. See:

`python run.py ingest --help`

### Run the application

 ```bash
 python app.py
 ```
